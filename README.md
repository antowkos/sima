# SIMA

**Self Improvement Memory Agent**

SIMA is a project-local memory and skill layer for coding agents such as Claude Code and Codex.

The core mental model:

```text
work → evidence → local learning → clean archivist review → active memory/skill → better future brief
```

SIMA is not a replacement for normal coding workflows. Agents still inspect repos, use `gh`, edit files, run tests, and verify work normally. SIMA adds a durable learning loop around that work so useful project knowledge survives across fresh agent sessions without dumping raw logs or chat history into context.

## Install

### From the latest GitHub Release

Use GitHub CLI access:

```bash
mkdir -p /tmp/sima-install
cd /tmp/sima-install

# SIMA currently ships prereleases, so resolve the newest GitHub release explicitly.
tag="$(gh release list --repo antowkos/sima --limit 1 --json tagName --jq '.[0].tagName')"
version="${tag#v}"
archive="sima_${version}_darwin_arm64.tar.gz"

gh release download "$tag" \
  --repo antowkos/sima \
  --pattern "$archive"

tar -xzf "$archive"
install -m 0755 "sima_${version}_darwin_arm64/sima" ~/.local/bin/sima

~/.local/bin/sima version
```

Features currently on `main` but not yet tagged are available by building from source until the next release.

Pick the matching archive for your platform:

- `darwin_arm64`
- `darwin_amd64`
- `linux_arm64`
- `linux_amd64`
- `windows_amd64`

### Build from source

From a SIMA source checkout:

```bash
./install.sh
sima version
```

Then initialize a project explicitly:

```bash
cd /path/to/project
sima setup
sima doctor .
sima lint .
```

## Use inside agents

SIMA is designed to be used by agents during real work, not only by humans from a terminal.

After setup:

```bash
cd /path/to/project
sima setup
```

SIMA writes:

```text
.sima/                         # project-local memory, skills, runs, evidence, config
CLAUDE.md                      # Claude Code project instructions
AGENTS.md                      # Codex/OpenAI agent project instructions
.claude/commands/sima.md       # Claude slash command: /sima <task>
.claude/commands/sima-brief.md # Claude slash command: /sima-brief <task>
.claude/commands/sima-remember.md # Claude slash command: /sima-remember <knowledge>
.codex/skills/sima/SKILL.md    # Codex skill for /sima-like SIMA flow
.codex/skills/sima-brief/SKILL.md # Codex skill for SIMA briefing
.codex/skills/sima-remember/SKILL.md # Codex skill for durable memory requests
```

`CLAUDE.md` and `AGENTS.md` receive an upserted managed block:

```html
<!-- BEGIN SIMA MANAGED INSTRUCTIONS -->
...
<!-- END SIMA MANAGED INSTRUCTIONS -->
```

Content outside the managed block is preserved. Re-running `sima setup` or `sima install` updates the SIMA block without replacing the rest of the file.

### After upgrading SIMA

After installing a newer SIMA binary, refresh existing projects so agents pick up new instructions, slash commands, and Codex skills:

```bash
sima version
sima install --client all --path .
sima doctor .
sima lint .
```

This updates only SIMA-managed sections/files and preserves project-owned content. Existing `.sima/config.yaml` values are not silently overwritten by new defaults, so apply release-note config changes intentionally. If embedding retrieval is enabled or knowledge was bulk/manual edited, also run:

For example, older projects may still have `brief.embedding.min_score: 0.2`; `sima install` preserves that value. For the bundled E5 helper, update existing configs to the current recommendation, `min_score: 0.85`, if unrelated cards are still being included.

```bash
sima index rebuild --path .
```

### How to prompt Claude/Codex

Use a prompt like:

```text
Use SIMA for this task. Start with `sima brief`, do the normal repo workflow, verify with tests, then run `sima learn` only for durable lessons.

Task: <your task>
```

Typical agent commands:

```bash
sima brief "<task>" --path .
# inspect repo, edit files, run tests/builds normally
sima learn --backend <backend-name> --task "<task>" --path .
```

When an agent formulates `<task>`, it should preserve the user's intent but keep separable intents as clear clauses divided by `и`, `and`, commas, or semicolons. Example: `fix guard-else-return in SupportConfig.swift, open PR with the repo template`. This helps deterministic query decomposition split multi-topic tasks before embedding retrieval.

If embedding retrieval is enabled in `.sima/config.yaml`, rebuild vectors for existing or bulk-edited knowledge with:

```bash
sima index rebuild --path .
```

SIMA stores those vectors in `.sima/index/embeddings.jsonl`. New/updated learned cards refresh the index during `sima apply`; manual edits are detected by metadata hashes and refreshed lazily during `sima brief`. For E5-style embeddings the default `min_score` is `0.85`; raise/lower it per project if briefs are too broad or too sparse. `top_k_per_part`/`min_part_score` provide bounded rescue for matches below that threshold: decomposed part rescue requires another high-confidence match in the same task, and whole-task rescue requires a non-generic lexical anchor so branch-name words like `feature` do not become fallback matches.

For explicit memory requests, agents should call:

```bash
sima remember "<durable project knowledge>" \
  --source user \
  --type <decision|invariant|gotcha|workflow|guardrail|anti_pattern|open_question> \
  --trigger "When ..." \
  --path .
```

Claude Code reads `CLAUDE.md`; Codex/OpenAI agents read `AGENTS.md`. Claude Code also gets project slash commands, so you can type:

```text
/sima fix the failing auth tests
/sima-brief plan the database migration
/sima-remember API handlers must use generated request types
```

See [Using SIMA with Agents](docs/agent-usage.md) for exact Claude/Codex flows, PR-review usage, backend setup, and safety rules. Codex gets project skills under `.codex/skills/...`; verified Codex prompt input includes these skills, so `/sima`-style prompts can route through the SIMA skill path when Codex passes them to the model.

## Core flow

```text
1. User asks for work
2. Agent/SIMA runs `sima brief`
3. Agent does normal repo/tool workflow
4. Agent verifies with tests/builds/checks
5. SIMA stores run evidence
6. Worker proposes only durable memory/skills, if any
7. Clean archivist reviews the proposal
8. Deterministic apply gates check safety, lifecycle, conflicts, and schema
9. Safe personal/local knowledge becomes active
10. Later briefs retrieve active knowledge only
```

Important rules:

- personal/local learning can auto-apply after archivist + apply-ready gates;
- transient task progress should stay in run evidence, not active memory;
- malformed structured output becomes inspectable candidate data, not silent memory;
- inactive/deprecated/superseded/archived knowledge stays auditable but is not injected into briefs;
- skills are for reusable workflows, not one-off summaries.

## Team flow

Team knowledge should be promoted, not born shared.

The intended team model is:

```text
local learn → personal active memory/skill → explicit team proposal → PR review → merge → team pull → future briefs
```

A developer or agent first proves a memory/skill locally. If it is useful beyond one person, SIMA should propose it to a shared team knowledge repository through a normal pull request. Team knowledge becomes authoritative only after review and merge.

Implemented consumption commands:

```bash
sima team init --repo <git-url> [--ref main] --path .
sima team pull --path .
sima team status --path .
```

`team init` stores a read-only mirror config:

```yaml
team:
  repo: <git-url>
  ref: main
  auto_apply: false
  sync_mode: mirror
```

`team pull` clones/fetches the shared knowledge repo into `.sima/team/source` and mirrors these reviewed artifacts into the local project:

```text
memory/cards/*   → .sima/team/memory/cards/*
skills/active/*  → .sima/team/skills/active/*
```

`team status` reports whether the repo is configured/cloned and how many team memory cards/skills are available locally.

Planned promotion command: `team propose` should create a reviewable PR containing the memory/skill, trigger, evidence, source local item, safety notes, and rationale for why it belongs in team scope.
